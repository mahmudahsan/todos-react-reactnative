## Technology Used
1. [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
2. [Expo](https://expo.io/@mahmudahsan)
3. And some other 3rd party libraries mentioned in code

## Features
This is my first react native and expo based project. So I wanted to develop a simple todo list application with nothing fancy. 

But in future I may update it with more feature like authentication, cloud data synching features and more.

## Setup in local machine
1. In your machine, you have to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

2. On terminal run command `yarn install` it will check the app's package.json file and install all libraries

3. `yarn start` will start expo and you can run in simulator or your device

## Publish in Google Play and Apple Store
1. Change and modify the `config/Settings.js` 

2. Change and modify the `assets/icon.png` 

3. [Expo Build](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/distribution/building-standalone-apps/) has detailed description how to build and submit your app.

4. Android [App Signing](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/distribution/app-signing/)

5. Apple [app store submission](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/distribution/app-stores/)
